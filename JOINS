CROSS JOIN:
Select * from orders  where customer_id=
       (
       select id from customers where
       last_name = 'George'
       )
       
       ====> Select * from orders,customers
       
       cross join gives all the records of both the table duplicatly
        run again for all the rows.
        
        implicit inner join we dont put any join condition but  do it like:
        
        selct first_name, last_name, order_date, amount,from customers, 
        orders where customer.id =order.customer_id
        
        expilicit inner join
        
        select * from customers join orders on customers.id= orders.cutsomer_id
        
        arbitary join: need not to use this as it doesn't serves the purpose
        
        selct * from customers join orders on customers.id=orders.id;
        
        SELECT * FROM customers, orders 
WHERE customers.id = orders.customer_id;
-- IMPLICIT INNER JOIN

SELECT first_name, last_name, order_date, amount
FROM customers, orders 
    WHERE customers.id = orders.customer_id;
    ========================imp info====================
    Cross join doesnt use join statement
    default join is inner join
    inner join: where records match
    
    LEFT:
    select * from customers c left join orders o on c.id=o.customer_id; 
    Right:
    select * from customers c right join orders o on c.id=o.customer_id; 
    
    ifnull:
    -------------------------
    
    SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
SELECT * FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;    
SELECT * FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;    
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
